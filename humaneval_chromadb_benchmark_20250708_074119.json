The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it processes each character once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it stores the input string and the list of separate groups.",

          "solution": "Based on the insights, here's how you can approach the task:\n\n1. Handle Edge Cases: The function should be able to handle edge cases such as an empty list or a list with only one element. If the input list is empty, the function should return an empty list. If the list contains only one element, the function should check if the substring is present in that element and return the list accordingly.\n\n2. Use List Comprehensions: List comprehensions can be used to filter the list of strings. This approach is efficient and makes the code more readable.\n\n3. Test the Function: After writing the function, test it with different inputs to ensure it works correctly. Include tests for the edge cases mentioned above.\n\nHere's the updated function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\" Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring\n    >>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')\n    []\n    >>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')\n    ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle edge cases\n    if not strings:\n        return []\n    \n    # Use list comprehension to filter the list\n    return [s for s in strings if substring in s]\n```\n\nAnd here are some tests:\n\n```python\nassert filter_by_substring([], 'a') == []\nassert filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a') == ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']\nassert filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'z') == []\nassert filter_by_substring(['abc'], 'a') == ['abc']\nassert filter_by_substring(['abc'], 'z') == []\n```\n\nThese tests cover the edge cases and ensure that the function works correctly.",

It uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module along with the `mul` function from the `operator` module to calculate the product of the numbers in the list. The `reduce` function applies a binary function (in this case, multiplication) to all items of a sequence (the list of numbers) in a cumulative way. The third argument to `reduce` is the initializer, which is set to 1 so that the product of an empty list is 1.\n\nThe edge case of an empty list is handled at the beginning of the function. If the list is empty, the function immediately returns a tuple of (0, 1), which is the sum and product of an empty list, respectively.\n\nThis solution is efficient and readable, and it handles all edge cases correctly. It can be tested with a variety of inputs, including empty lists, lists with one element, and lists with multiple elements.",
