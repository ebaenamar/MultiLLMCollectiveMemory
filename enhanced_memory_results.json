It raises a ValueError if the input is not a list of numbers or if the threshold is not a number or is negative. This ensures that the function behaves predictably and provides useful error messages.\n\nThe function also includes a docstring that explains what the function does, what its parameters are, and what it returns. This makes the function easier to understand and use.\n\nThe function is well-tested with the provided test cases. It correctly returns False for the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] with a threshold of 0.5, and True for the list [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0] with a threshold of 0.3.
