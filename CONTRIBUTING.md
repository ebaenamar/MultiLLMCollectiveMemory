2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
3. **Testing**: Unit tests for all new functionality
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and failures

### Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Optimize for large-scale experiments
2. **Computational Cost**: Consider token usage and API costs
3. **Scalability**: Design for larger agent teams and longer tasks
4. **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies

### Integration Requirements

1. **Docker Support**: Ensure new components work in containerized environment
2. **Configuration**: Use YAML/JSON for configuration management
3. **Logging**: Integrate with existing logging framework
4. **Monitoring**: Add appropriate metrics and health checks

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Brief description of what the function does.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of first parameter
        param2: Description of second parameter
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing the results with keys:
        - 'status': Success/failure indicator
        - 'data': Main result data
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When param2 is negative
        
    Example:
        >>> result = example_function("test", 5)
        >>> print(result['status'])
        'success'
