# Emergent Collective Memory in Multi-LLM Systems: A Benchmark for Distributed Cognitive Architectures

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges when dealing with complex, multi-step reasoning tasks under context limitations. While recent work has explored individual agent memory systems, the potential of **collective memory** in multi-LLM architectures remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to evaluate the impact of shared persistent memory on collaborative reasoning tasks, comparing four distinct configurations: single-agent baseline, multi-agent without memory, multi-agent with shared memory, and multi-agent with private memory systems. Our findings suggest that collective memory can significantly improve task accuracy while reducing computational redundancy, providing insights for future scalable AI architectures.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Current LLM benchmarks (GAIA, AgentBench, etc.) primarily focus on individual agent performance, leaving a critical gap in understanding how **collaborative memory systems** impact multi-agent reasoning. The "lost in the middle" problem identified by Liu et al. (2023) highlights context limitations that could potentially be mitigated through distributed memory architectures.

### 1.2 Research Questions

1. **RQ1**: How does shared persistent memory affect accuracy in multi-step collaborative reasoning tasks?
2. **RQ2**: What is the computational efficiency gain from collective memory vs. isolated agent memory?
3. **RQ3**: Under what conditions does memory sharing introduce noise vs. beneficial knowledge transfer?

### 1.3 Contributions

- **Novel Benchmark**: First standardized evaluation framework for collective memory in multi-LLM systems
- **Comprehensive Comparison**: Four distinct memory configurations with controlled variables
- **Practical Insights**: Guidelines for implementing distributed memory in production AI systems
- **Open Framework**: Reproducible experimental setup for future research

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Multi-Agent LLM Systems

Recent advances in multi-agent frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph) have demonstrated improved performance on complex tasks through agent specialization and collaboration. However, these systems typically rely on conversation history rather than persistent, structured memory.

### 2.2 Memory Systems in AI

- **Voyager** (Wang et al., 2023): Skill memory for embodied agents
- **MemGPT** (Packer et al., 2023): Hierarchical memory management
- **Reflexion** (Shinn et al., 2023): Self-reflection and memory for improvement

**Gap**: No systematic evaluation of **collective vs. individual** memory in multi-agent reasoning.

### 2.3 Context Limitations

The "lost in the middle" phenomenon (Liu et al., 2023) shows that LLMs struggle with long contexts. Distributed memory could provide an alternative to simply increasing context windows.
