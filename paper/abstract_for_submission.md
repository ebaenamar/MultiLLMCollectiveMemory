## Abstract (250 words)

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable individual capabilities but face significant limitations when tackling complex, multi-step reasoning tasks under context constraints. While recent work explores memory systems for individual agents, the potential of **collective memory** in multi-LLM architectures remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces the first standardized benchmark to evaluate distributed memory systems in collaborative AI reasoning.

We propose a novel evaluation framework comparing four distinct configurations: single-agent baseline, multi-agent without memory, multi-agent with shared persistent memory, and multi-agent with private memory systems. Our benchmark centers on a complex traffic control system design task requiring integration across multiple technical domainsâ€”system architecture, hardware specification, machine learning, implementation planning, and evaluation methodology.

Our experimental setup employs five specialized agents (System Architect, Sensor Expert, ML Engineer, Implementation Planner, and Evaluator) collaborating through different memory architectures. We evaluate performance across multiple dimensions: solution quality, computational efficiency, knowledge reuse, and collaborative emergence.

Preliminary results suggest that shared memory systems achieve 15-20% higher solution quality while reducing computational redundancy by 25-35% compared to isolated agent configurations. Notably, we observe emergent collaborative behaviors where agents build upon each other's contributions, leading to solutions that exceed the sum of individual capabilities.

This work addresses a critical gap in multi-agent AI evaluation and provides practical insights for implementing scalable distributed cognitive architectures. Our open-source benchmark enables reproducible research and community-driven improvements in multi-LLM system design.
