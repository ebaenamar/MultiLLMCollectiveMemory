            3. **Regular Reports**: Weekly, monthly, and quarterly assessments
            4. **Citizen Feedback**: Mobile app and web portal for user input

            ### Validation Methodology:
            - A/B Testing: Compare optimized vs. traditional signal timing
            - Before/After Analysis: Historical baseline comparison
            - Simulation Validation: Digital twin for scenario testing
            - Third-party Audits: Independent performance verification
